# JavaScript Roman Numerals

## Learning Competencies

* Getting familiar with programmatic JavaScript
* Getting familiar with a barebones implementation of client-side JavaScript

## Summary

We're going to solve the roman numerals problem in JavaScript!
[You know how this works.](../../../roman-numerals-challenge)

## Releases

### Release 0: How does this thing work?

At the command line, run this:
```
open index.html
```

This should open a (terrible looking) webpage with a simple form. If you enter
a number and hit the 'convert' button, it returns... undefined to the page. But
once you're done with it, It'll return the correct value!

### Release 1: Make it functional!

We've already set up the basic DOM manipulation structure, all you need to do
is write the logic for converting input in romans.js. You need to make the
.numeralConverter() function operational! Feel free to use helper functions,
which you can define inside romans.js.
